# API_Based_ChatGPT_Portal
This repository contains the code for a simple web application that allows groups of users to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT using a single OpenAI API key. The purpose of this application is to enable users to access ChatGPT without each needing their own account. If you have a GPT-4 API key, you can easily edit the code to work with the GPT-4 API as well.
